##### Test Level Converter with Arduino Mega, Osciliscope
- build circuit with one Level-Converter with 3.3V & 5V volt from arduino
- hook Scopte on one paired channel
- Test functionalities with a jumper wire one both side, figure out what does Level Converter do
> - Figure out this Level Converter has built in pull-up resister.
> - If `SCL` and `SDA` of BlinkM is floating, `SDA` is pulled up, `SCL` is pull low.
